# Cplusplus-Program

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
<br>
The project I choose was project number one which was the clock app using C++ programming langauge.
The clock app had to display a 24-hour format along with a 12-hour format.
It gives the option to add an hour, add a mintue or add a second and exit the program from the user on the main page.
The problem I was having was having it change to an hour when the 60 minutes were over and by adding that extra hour.

**What did you do particularly well?**
<br>
I believe I did particualry well in creating menus and using the switch statements 
between the option case and using comments in my codes.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
<br>
On my 12-hour clock code, I could enhance it by making sure when it reaches 12:00 pm, it shows up at 12 and not 00. 
I wasn't able to completely figure out how to do that. I felt like there was a bug in my code that I just wasn't 
able to quite figure out.


**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
<br>
Using the declartion of enum for AM or PM for 12 hour clock was challenging for me, I wasn't sure how I could 
seperate the 12 hour and 24 hour clock without messing it up too badly. I did use google to help me understand 
what to do and how the use of an enum would help with my project.


**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
<br>
Critial thinking skills I used for this project helped me understand what needed to be done. 
I have a feeling for the rest of my course work for my other classes learning what I learend and doing 
what I did will show me how to use my brain and to make sure I can understand what is going on and what is
being asked of me.


**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
<br>
I made sure to use proper comments in my code, used proper variable names that where easy to read and understand. Tried to space out as much as I can so the code wasn't all mixed together and unreadable.
